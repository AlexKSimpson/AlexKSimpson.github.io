![Picture](small-pic.jpeg)

I am professor of computer science at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia.  I also work at the Institute for Mathematics, Physics and Mechanics, Ljubljana. 
Before 2015, I was based at the Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science, School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, where from 2010 I held a personal chair in foundations of computer science.

I am interested in the foundations of mathematics and computer science and in interactions between them.
