# Alex Simpson

I am professor of computer science at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. 
Before 2015, I was based at the Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science, School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, where from 2010 I held a personal chair in foundations of computer science.

I am interested in the foundations of mathematics and computer science and the interaction between them.
