I am professor of computer science at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. 
Before 2015, I was based in the Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science at the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, where from 2010 I held a personal chair in foundations of computer science.
